# Project Overview
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a branch of computer science and technology that focuses on creating systems, software, or machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, problem-solving, learning, perception, natural language understanding, and decision-making. AI aims to develop intelligent agents that can mimic and replicate human-like cognitive functions.
